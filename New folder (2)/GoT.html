            <h2>Story - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                **Ghost of Tsushima** delivers an unforgettable story of **Jin Sakai**, a samurai caught between tradition and the harsh reality of war. As the Mongol Empire invades Tsushima Island, Jin must evolve from a traditional samurai warrior into the Ghost, embracing stealth and unconventional tactics to defend his home and people. The story is emotionally gripping, with profound themes of honor, sacrifice, and the personal cost of war. The narrative is expertly told, with deeply developed characters and compelling arcs that keep you engaged from beginning to end.

            <h2>Gameplay - 8/10</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay of **Ghost of Tsushima** is, for the most part, exhilarating. The **sword combat** is fluid, and the game offers a satisfying blend of stealth, exploration, and action. However, the experience can feel somewhat **repetitive**. While the game’s core mechanics are strong, the number of similar side quests, enemy camps, and collectibles can make the world feel somewhat monotonous over time. The lack of variety in mission types and enemy design leads to a sense of repetition that holds back what could have been an even more engaging experience. Despite this, the game remains fun and rewarding overall, especially for fans of open-world adventures.

            <h2>Graphics & Scenery - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                **Ghost of Tsushima** features some of the most stunning visuals in modern gaming. The island of Tsushima is beautifully rendered, with lush forests, rolling hills, dense bamboo groves, and pristine beaches. The art direction is nothing short of breathtaking, with each area meticulously crafted to create an immersive experience. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add another layer of realism to the world. The visuals are complemented by a beautiful color palette, with warm golden fields and rich green forests providing a striking contrast to the game’s more intense moments. The beauty of Tsushima is a testament to the power of PlayStation hardware and the attention to detail by the developers.

            <h2>Bosses - 8/10</h2>
            <p>
                The **boss battles** in **Ghost of Tsushima** are memorable, but they lack the depth and variety that could have elevated them further. While the sword duels are engaging and can be challenging, many of the bosses feel similar to one another in terms of mechanics and design. There is a lack of variation in how the bosses are structured, and some of them feel repetitive in both their attacks and visual design. Despite this, the boss battles remain enjoyable, with certain encounters standing out for their emotional weight and impact on the story. However, there’s room for more innovation in this area to truly elevate the experience.

            <h2>Final rating 9/10</h2>
            <p>Ghost of Tsushima is a beautiful and engaging action-adventure game that immerses players in the life of a samurai during the Mongol invasion of Japan. While the gameplay can become repetitive and the boss fights lack variety, the rich story, breathtaking graphics, and emotional journey make it a must-play title for fans of open-world games.</p>
