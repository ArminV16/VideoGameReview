            <h2>Story - 7/10</h2>
            <p>
                Sekiro's story follows the journey of **Shinobi Wolf**, a warrior on a mission to rescue his kidnapped lord. While the plot offers a compelling revenge story with themes of sacrifice and honor, it doesn't dive as deep as other narratives in action games. The story is engaging but feels somewhat linear at times, with limited character development beyond the protagonist.

            <h2>Gameplay - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay of Sekiro is exceptional, offering intense swordplay that requires precision, timing, and strategy. The posture-based combat system is incredibly satisfying, with each encounter feeling both challenging and rewarding. The addition of stealth mechanics, exploration, and a variety of tools (such as the grappling hook) creates a dynamic and engaging experience that sets it apart from other action games.

The attention to detail is breathtaking, and the scenery is both beautiful and atmospheric.

            <h2>Bosses - 9/10</h2>
            <p>
                The bosses in Sekiro are some of the most memorable and challenging in recent gaming history. Each boss has its own distinct moveset and unique abilities that require players to learn, adapt, and master the combat mechanics. Some bosses are incredibly tough and will test your patience, but the sense of achievement after defeating them is unmatched. The only downside is that a few bosses can feel repetitive in their design or tactics.
