            <h2>Story - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                Bloodborne’s story immerses players in the gothic, cursed city of **Yharnam**, where the **Hunter** is tasked with uncovering dark secrets and battling monstrous creatures. The narrative is rooted in **Lovecraftian horror**, blending themes of madness, transformation, and the unknown. Though the story isn’t always handed to the player directly, the game’s cryptic lore invites exploration and rewards curiosity. Every piece of the narrative feels significant, and the ambiguity adds to the eerie atmosphere, making the world feel rich and mysterious. It's a captivating tale, full of twists, steeped in dread, and ultimately unforgettable.

            <h2>Gameplay - 9/10</h2>
            <p>
                Bloodborne’s fast-paced combat is one of its strongest suits, offering a visceral and rewarding experience. The game encourages **aggressive play** with a focus on dodging, quick reflexes, and using fluid weapon transformations. While the combat is outstanding, the game’s **locked 30 FPS** on PlayStation 4 can cause some issues, especially during intense combat sequences. This limitation can make the experience feel less smooth than it could be, especially for players used to higher frame rates. Still, despite this technical limitation, the gameplay is tight, rewarding, and immensely satisfying.

            <h2>Graphics & Scenery - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                The visual design of Bloodborne is stunning and haunting. From the dark, fog-filled streets of **Yharnam** to the eerie landscapes of the **Chalice Dungeons**, every location is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of dread. The detailed environments, combined with the game's dynamic lighting and weather effects, enhance the gothic atmosphere. The game’s enemy and character design is equally impressive, with grotesque creatures and hauntingly beautiful architecture that captivate and disturb in equal measure. Bloodborne's visuals are a testament to the power of artistic direction, creating an unforgettable world.

            <h2>Bosses - 10/10</h2>
            <p>
                One of Bloodborne’s standout features is its **boss battles**. The game is filled with terrifying and memorable bosses, each with its own unique design, moveset, and lore. These encounters are intense and challenging, requiring precise timing, strategy, and patience. The thrill of overcoming these monumental foes is unmatched. Whether it’s a grotesque, eldritch entity or a tragic, human adversary, each boss feels integral to the game’s world and narrative. The sense of accomplishment after defeating them is immense, making each victory feel well-earned.
